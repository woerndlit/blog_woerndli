# New beginnings

As I'm facing new opportunities and challenges in 2021, I've decided to tackle an old project and start a Blog again.
Content will be focused on technical challenges and solutions I'm facing in my day to day work in IT as well as IT related hobby projects.

## Motivation

I have faced a lot of different technical challenges in my almost 20 years working in IT.
Often, consulting multiple blog articles helped me to design solutions that benefited me and my customers.
This Blog shall give something back to the community and hopefully help others a little as other blogs helped me in the past.
